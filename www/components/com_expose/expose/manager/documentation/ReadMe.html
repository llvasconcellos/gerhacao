					img, xml, and config folders</b>).</p>
				<p>You may need to give write permissions to the web server user for the following files and folders: <strong>expose/img/</strong>, <strong>expose/xml/</strong>, <strong>manager/bucket/</strong>, <strong>manager/amfphp/extra/passhash.inc.php</strong>, and <strong>manager/amfphp/extra/settings.xml</strong>.</p>
				<p>Should you run into any problems, you can try opening <b>check_system.php</b> in a web browser to see if the script will detect the culprit. </p></td>

				<td class="sectiontext">
					To start load the Album Manager in a web browser by typing the URL of the <strong>manager.html</strong>					file, e.g. <b>http://www.example.com/expose/manager/manager.html</b>.
					<p>
					The first thing you want to do is change the default password, which is <b>manager</b>.
					Click on the <b>Change password</b> button and enter the new password.
					<p>
					Now use your new login password to log in.
					<p>
					Once you see the main interface, have a look at the screenshot at the bottom of this
					readme page to get an idea about what each button does.
					<p>
					The changes you make -- with the exception of the photo and album descriptions, which
					require that you specifically initiate their updates -- commit
					immediately, and you can preview the edits in expos&eacute; right away.
					<p>
					If you decide you want to embed your own watermark at the bottom right corner of each
					image, you will need to create a transparent PNG image that contains it, and replace <strong>watermark.png</strong>					with it. You can find <strong>watermark.png</strong> in <strong>manager/amfphp/extra/</strong>. There is no restriction on
					the dimensions of the watermark.
					<p>
					You may also use your own TTF font to render the copyright text in each image. To do so
					replace <strong>manager/fonts/embedcopy.ttf</strong> with your TTF file.
					<p>
					Every time you create an album or a collection a default thumbnail image gets assigned
					to them. You can create your own custom thumbnail images (64x48 pixels recommended) and
					replace <strong>albthumb.jp</strong>g and <strong>collthumb.jpg</strong> located in<strong> manager/amfphp/extra/</strong> with your own 
					copies.

					<p>Album Manager allows adding photos and videos from a "bucket". The bucket is a folder on the web server where you can upload the source images and videos for later adding
					to your media collection. You might find it easier to FTP your files instead of using
					the uploading features in Album Manager, which is where the bucket would come in handy.</p>
					<p>The bucket folder is located in <strong>manager/bucket/</strong>. </p>
					<p>In the window for adding media from the bucket you can filter the list of files by entering the bits of file name to look for into the filter text input and pressing Enter. For example, if you upload some images in to a <strong>vacation</strong> folder inside the bucket, and some other images into a <strong>wedding</strong> folder in the bucket, you can shrink the list to see only the images in the <strong>vacation</strong> folder by entering <strong>vacation/</strong> into the filter text input and pressing Enter. The filter applies simultaneously to the list of photos and videos. </p></td>
