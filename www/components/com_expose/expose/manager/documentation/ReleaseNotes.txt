Album Manager for PHP 1.02 Release Notes
----------------------------------------


BUGFIXES:

When adding photos/videos from the bucket without having selected at least one item the application would go into an infinite loop.

The album list would become jumbled after uploading a photo/video or adding items from the bucket.


NEW FEATURES:

The main view now shows the ID of the selected album/collection and photo.

The main view now contains Help button which launches ReadMe.html from the documentation folder. The help button can be disabled by setting the helpEnabled FlashVars parameter to "no".

If the autoLogin FlashVars parameter is set to "yes", Album Manager will try to auto-login by sending a blank password to the server. This can be useful, if, for example, the user has already been authenticated by other means, in which case the _authenticate function in AlbumManager.php can be rewritten to authenticate using the system's method (e.g. session variable).

The package now contains a check_system.php script that can be run to verify that the PHP configuration will run Album Manager and that the required file permissions have been set correctly. REMOVE THIS FILE UPON A SUCCESSFUL CHECK AS IT MAY POSE A SECURITY RISK!

The images and videos are now stored in a separate folder for each album inside the img/ folder. This will reduce clutter for large photosets.

The default size of the interface text can be set with the textSize FlashVars parameter.

The font of the interface text can be set with the textFontFamily FlashVars parameter.

The interface text can be localized by editing misc/strings.xml, and setting the proper language with the language FlashVars parameter in manager.html.


CHANGED FEATURES:

The AutoExpandCollections setting in settings.xml is not set to false by default. When this setting is set to true Album Manager automatically expands all collections in the album/collection list.


REMOVED FEATURES:

None.


IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 1.01:

Replace the passhash.inc.php, settings.xml, watermark.png, and embedcopy.ttf files in the package with your copies, and deploy the new package in place of the old manager.
